# miniscript-c

An unofficial, pure C99 (absolutely no C++) implementation of the [Miniscript](https://miniscript.org/) programming language.

Unlike the [official implementations](https://github.com/joestrout/miniscript), this one uses a stack-based virtual machine instead of three-argument code, and the files are structured รก la Lox (and mainly because I didn't want to deal with register allocation haha).

The implementation is not yet ready, but it's stored here for backup reasons and for the interested.
